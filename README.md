# React Unsplash Api Challenge

## Goal:
#### Membuat mini project React yang menampilkan gambar dari Unsplash dengan syarat

- [✅] Fork this repo into your GitHub account. Keep it public until we have been able to review it.
- [✅] Use `create-react-app` to set up a basic single-page React application as shown here: https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app. (NOTE: We will only focus on creating a single-page React application, so don't worry about the other sections on that page such as Next.js).
- [✅] Refer to the Unsplash API docs here to set up a developer account: https://unsplash.com/documentation.
- [✅] Display a grid of photos in your React app. Use the `GET /photos/random` endpoint from the Unsplash API to get a set of curated images.
- [✅] The grid of photos should preserve the aspect ratio of the photos it's displaying, meaning it shouldn't crop the image in any way.
- [✅] The grid should be responsive, and should work in both portrait and landscape orientations on both mobile and desktop browsers.
- [✅] The grid should support infinite scrolling, using a lazy-load strategy to fetch additional images as the user scrolls.
- [❌] When the user taps on a photo on the grid it should show the full photo in a full width lightbox popup with more information about the photo.
- [❌] The lightbox popup should be dismissible with a close button.
- [❌] Add left/right arrows or swiping to the lightbox, to allow browsing the previous/next images without dismissing the popup.
- [❌] You're free to use existing open source React components or Javascript packages/libraries from npm to complete this task.
